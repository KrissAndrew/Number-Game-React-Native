This is a number guessing application I created using React Native.
It takes a number input from the user and attempts to guess what it is based on user feedback.

Note that whilst this is my work the idea was taken from Maximilian Schwartzmiller's
course "React Native - The Practical Guide" - https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/
